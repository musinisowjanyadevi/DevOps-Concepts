1\. Introduction to Docker



What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications with their dependencies into lightweight containers.



Why Docker?



* Works on any environment ("runs on my machine" problem solved).
* Lightweight compared to VMs.
* Easy scaling and CI/CD integration.
